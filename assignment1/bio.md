My name is Hunter Tulipan. I was born in Nashville, TN, which is also where I currently live. My hobbies include camping, rock-climbing, reading fantasy novels, and playing video games. My primary academic focus up to this point has been in Physics. I enjoy music in bluegrass, folk, and similar genres. My undergraduate education took place at Lehigh University and at Washington University in St. Louis. Few people know this, but my real training is in infiltration and subterfuge.

Programming Background:
I am cuurently in my third quarter of classes at OSU. I am currently taking Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Operating Systems, and Software Engineering in addition to this class. I have some experience programming in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and HTML. Before starting classes at OSU, I had taken a single intro course that was run using Java, and I had done some work with Physics simulations run using Fortran.
